## 🦆 The Waddle’s Way
An experimental shrine where ideas stroll in no particular hurry —  
testing their wings, splashing in the shallows, and sometimes  
taking flight into the greater canon.  

Here, whimsy meets precision.  
Every step, no matter how meandering, leaves a mark in the lineage.

---

## 🎯 Purpose in the Canon
- **Sandbox for Playful Automation** — trial runs for scripts, flows, and ceremonial triggers.  
- **Crest‑Marked Documentation Experiments** — testing new ways to present lore and law.  
- **Incubator for Lighthearted Features** — ideas that may one day migrate to the Basilica Gate.  
- **Echo Chamber for Whimsy** — a safe place for experiments that delight without disrupting.

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
This experimental shrine waddles freely, yet never beyond the crest’s shadow.  
Commits may be swift, but the lineage remembers all steps — even the whimsical ones.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
